# Betting Dashboard

Create a simple dashboard that displays betting information for different sports games using React and TypeScript.

## **Objective**

Design a responsive, user-friendly dashboard to facilitate users in placing bets on various sports games.

## **Requirements**

### 1. **Dashboard Design**
* Design a responsive grid-based dashboard.
* Display multiple cards, each representing a sports game.

### 2. **Card Information**
Each card should:
* Display the names of the competing teams.
* Present the odds for each team.
* Have a button to facilitate betting.
* Show the total number of bets placed on each team (Note: This can be a simulated number for the assignment).

### 3. **Interactivity**
* On clicking the “Place a bet” button, a modal should appear. This modal will let users choose a team and decide their bet amount.
* After submitting the bet, the displayed number of bets on the selected team should increase (Note: No real betting mechanism or backend integration is needed for this assignment).

### 4. **TypeScript Integration**
* Ensure proper typing for React components, state, and props.
* Develop an interface for a sports game.

### 5. **Bonus (Optional)**
* Introduce a filter mechanism allowing users to sift through games based on sports types: Soccer, Basketball, Baseball, etc.
* Utilize a state management tool (e.g., Redux or MobX) for streamlined state handling.
* Use CSS-in-JS libraries such as styled-components or emotion for styling.

### 6. **Notes**
* Mock data can be employed for games and odds, eliminating the need for backend integration.
* You're free to create your own mock data structure or modify the one provided.
* Prioritize code quality, reusability, and readability. Even if basic, the styling should be clean and organized.
* Please use git and add meaningful commits wherever applicable.


### 7. Evaluation Criteria:
* Code quality, reusability, and readability.
* Adherence to React and TypeScript best practices.
* UI/UX considerations.
